# Hitsgame

This is a customized version based on the original [Hitsgame by ruuda](https://github.com/ruuda/hitsgame).

Build your own version of the game [Hitster][hitster]. The resulting cards
contain a QR code that point to an audio file on a webserver, no Spotify is
needed to play. The program generates a pdf with cards like this:

## Ingredients

Ingredients:

 * A collection of properly tagged flac files. These files must have the
   `TITLE`, `ARTIST`, and `ORIGINALDATE` or `DATE` tags set.
 * A webserver that can serve static files.
 * Sheets of A4 paper, preferably 180 g/mÂ².
 * Tokens from the original Hitster game, or a suitable replacement,
   e.g. poker chips.

Hardware tools needed:

 * A printer.
 * Preferably a paper cutter, alternatively scissors.

Software tools needed:

 * Either [Nix 2.17.0][nix217], which can provide all the needed packages,
   run with `nix develop --command ./mkhitsgame.py`.
 * Or install manually:
   * Python â‰¥ 3.11 with `qrcode==7.4.2` package.
   * ffmpeg 5.1.3 or n6.1.
   * rsvg-convert (from librsvg) 2.55.1 or 2.57.1.

## Preparation

 1. Create a directory named `tracks` and put the tracks in there that you want
    to include.
 2. Create a file named `mkhitsgame.toml` next to the `tracks` directory, and
    add the configuration as shown in the next section.
 3. Run `mkhitsgame.py`. It will print statistics about the track distribution
    over years and decades, so you can tweak the track selection to balance out
    the game.
 4. You now have two new directories: `build` and `out`. `out` contains the
    tracks, compressed and anonymized. These files contain no metadata, and the
    file names are long enough to be virtually unguessable, so they are safe to
    serve from a public webserver without additional authentication. `build`
    contains the pdf with the cards, as well as intermediate svg files.
 5. Upload the contents of `out` to your webserver.
 6. Print `build/cards.pdf` and cut out the cards.

## Configuration

The `mkhitsgame.toml` file follows the following format:

```toml
# The url prefix that your webserver will serve the track mp4s from.
url_prefix = "http://example.com/"

# Font to use on the cards.
font = "Cantarell"

# Whether to draw a grid around the cards. If you want to inspect the pdf on
# your computer, or if you are cutting the cards with scissors, you probably
# want to enable this. If you are cutting with a paper cutter, you should
# disable the grid, because if you don't cut *exactly* on the line you'll end
# up with ugly lines on the sides of the cards.
grid = true

# Whether to include crop marks at the sides of the page. If you are cutting
# with a paper cutter, you should enable this to know where to cut.
crop_marks = false

# Default language for the application. Optional.
# If not specified, English ('en') will be used.
language = "en"

# Title for the game. Optional.
# If not specified, the default title from the translation file will be used.
title = "Hits Custom Version!"

# Default emoji for the game. Optional.
# If not specified, the default emoji will be a guitar (ðŸŽ¸).
emoji = "ðŸŽ¸"

# The directory where the output files will be stored. Optional.
# If not specified, the default directory 'out' will be used.
out_dir = "custom_out"
```

For the webserver, you need to configure it to serve the `.mp4` files with
`audio/mp4` MIME type. For Nginx, you can do this using the following snippet:

```nginx
types {
  audio/mp4 mp4;
}
```

## Deployment

The contents of the `out` directory should be uploaded to a web server, such as Nginx, to serve the game files. Below is an example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com/;

    root /var/www/html;

    location /songs/ {
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location / {
        try_files /index.html =404;
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that the `songs` directory serves the audio files, and the root serves the `index.html` file.

## How to play

Refer [the original game rules][howplay] for how to play the game itself. You
do not need to connect Spotify. Scanning a QR code will open the track in your
browser. Most browsers will auto-play the track.
